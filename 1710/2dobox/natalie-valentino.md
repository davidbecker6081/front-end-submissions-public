## Student: Natalie and Valentino
## Evaluator: Louisa
## Notes/What To Work On:

- UI needs a refining around new features
- CSS has opportunities for further refactoring
- JS has opportunities for further refactoring -- some repetitive functions
- worked well together! hit sticky spots but worked hard to understand how to fix it, paired with others, and worked to find solutions as a team
- team seemed uncomfortable/hesitant with refactoring. When tightening up one function, if it broke something else, they would revert back to the original function and abandon the refactor. This was said many times during our eval. That's ok! Comfort with refactoring takes time: keep at it, try to not worry when thing break, and don't give up -- that process is part of refactoring a codebase in this way. It can absolutely be frustrating, but it is also a very real part of working in an existing codebase.
