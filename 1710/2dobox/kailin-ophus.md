## Student: Kailin and Ophus
## Evaluator: Louisa
## Notes/What To Work On:

- overwhelmed by working within an existing codebase, struggled to track logic and thought process of original developer's code.
- focused on refactoring JS, no new functionality. JS still had opportunities for refactoring and clean up.
- didn't add any additional functionality, not all Ideabox functionality is solid (filter is case sensitive and hitting `enter` to leave an input isn't hooked up)
- localStorage broken on Ophus's machine, unclear what is going on, works on Kailin's (different branches locally?)
- lots of buggy behavior: first time upvote hits "critical" it becomes "undefined" on page load, and returns to "critical" after refreshing the page.
- CSS has a lot of opportunities for further refactoring, many unused properties and cruft. Make sure you are keeping in mind foundational CSS rules and box-model as you write CSS. Much of what is written in this codebase is either doing nothing (ie `display: block` on elements that are block by default (like a div, for example) or using `margin: auto` on elements that also have `display: inline-block` on them) or overriding properties in the same rule.
- I expected more progress to be made on this project, although it does seem like both team members learned a lot from the process of fighting with this code base, which is fantastic. Learning is always the #1 goal. It is unclear if it was a time management problem or if what was asked of them was overwhelming and the team didn't feel comfortable reaching out for help to get unstuck.
