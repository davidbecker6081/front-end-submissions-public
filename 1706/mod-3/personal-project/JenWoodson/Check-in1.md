## Project Name:
eighty-six systems (restaurant point-of-sale software)

#### Check In: 1

#### Project Pitch

### Deliverables

#### Stack:
React
Redux
Router

#### APIs:
unsure; possibly Google Drive to manage data
https://developers.google.com/drive/v2/reference/

#### Wireframes
in progress; using Sketch

#### Waffle & Github
https://github.com/jenPlusPlus/eighty-six-systems

#### Order Of Attack
complete wireframe
map/chart out user experience
use map/chart to determine app logic
build out necessary components

#####iteration 1
(enter menu data)
display menu data on page

#####iteration 2
(create user)
allow user log in

#####iteration 3
display user dashboard

#####iteration 4
allow user to enter table name
allow user to enter seat number
allow user to enter order by selecting menu data

#####iteration 5
allow user to print order to webpage

#### MVP
user (server) can log into app, enter table, seat, and order -- order is printed to webpage
user (server) can log into app and append to order on table/seat
user (admin) can log into app to access any table and edit
user (admin) can log into app to enter new users

#### Nice To Haves
user (admin) can enter new menu data and edit existing menu data
backend to store data

#### Biggest Challenges
managing all the data (users, tables, seats, menu)
where to put the data if not using a backend?
using relatively new tech (Redux) on my own
determining proper scope of MVP

#### Deliverables for next checkin:
