#### Order Of Attack
[x] complete wireframe
[x] map/chart out user experience
[] use map/chart to determine app logic
[] build out necessary components

#####iteration 1
(enter menu data to firebase)

#####iteration 2
(create user)
allow user log in

#####iteration 3
display user dashboard

#####iteration 4
allow user to enter table name
allow user to enter seat number
allow user to enter order by selecting menu data

#####iteration 5
allow user to print order to kitchen view

#### MVP
* Possibly hard code password access into system?
* Ability to create a new table
* Ability to create new seats for that table
* Ability to add order to specific seat
* When order is added, displays on kitchen view in order
* Kitchen view provides opportunity to click "Order Up" to remove from queue

#### Nice To Haves
* To Go orders
* Does kitchen have button to say "Order being worked on"
* Does that button need to be clicked before "Order Up"

#### Biggest Challenges
managing all the data (users, tables, seats, menu)
conditional renderinga and routing
using relatively new tech (Redux & Firebase) on my own

#### Deliverables for next checkin:
